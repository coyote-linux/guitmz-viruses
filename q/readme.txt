The files contained in q.7z are all live virii contained in .com or .exe 
files.

These are not source code, they are executables which can result in an
infection on DOS or Windows based systems if they are run with the 
proper system permissions. They are, however, properly detected by 
Windows Defender and many other commercial firewall products.
